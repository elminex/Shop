# Shop
Final project from Kodillas Web Developer Plus Bootcamp.
It uses React with Redux and React Router. It also has a simple Node.js server to get placeholder data from a .json file.

Working app is available [here](https://kodilla-awesome-shop.herokuapp.com/).

To start clone the repository, enter `npm install` in your terminal to install packages, and then run `npm start`. 
The server will run on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

For cart discount codes use `small`, `medium`, `high`.
Enjoy!
